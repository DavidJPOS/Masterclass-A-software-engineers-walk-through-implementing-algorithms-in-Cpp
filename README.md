## Outline

In this talk, James Giller will lead us through a simple implementation of a Kalman Filter in C++. A Kalman Filter is a method that takes a series of noisy time series and produces an estimate for one of the time series. For example, the smoothing of accelerometer data by combining its GPS data. He will walk through the considerations he would make when implementing such a method so that the resulting code would be both robust and computationally efficient. Time permitting, he will also illustrate a simple example of how to connect C++ code to R via the rcpp package. 

## Code

what code will we throw up before hand

## Software

Where does the software exists that we need to downlaod?
