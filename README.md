## Outline

For academics working in a computationally intensive field, writing code in C++ can drastically reduce the execution times of algorithms. The modern C++ language and standard library enable programmers to write expressive code efficiently, and have many useful features of scripting languages, such as Python, while maintaining the benefits of safety, and runtime speed.

In this talk, [James Giller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesgiller/) will lead us through a simple implementation of a Kalman Filter in C++, which can then be imported and used in R. A Kalman Filter is a method that takes a time series of noisy measurements of some system, and produces estimates for the system’s state variables — for example, estimating the kinematics of a vehicle from camera or LIDAR measurements. He will walk through the considerations he would make when implementing such a method so that the resulting code is both robust and computationally efficient. He will also illustrate a simple example of how to connect C++ code to R via the rcpp package. 

James Giller is a software engineer for Land Rover Jaguar and is currently working on implementing sensor fusion algorithms for use in autonomous driving vehicles. He holds an undergraduate degree in computer science from UCC, an MEng in robotics from Osaka University, Japan, and, before joining JLR, he worked extensively in software engineering for robotics.
